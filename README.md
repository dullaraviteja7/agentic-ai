# 🤖 AI Scrum Master Agent Proposal

## 🎯 Objective
To build a production-grade AI-powered Scrum Master Agent that automates coordination tasks for each scrum team, integrates with collaboration tools like MS Teams and Jira, and provides real-time visibility to the Project Manager via dashboards.

---

## 🧩 Key Features & Requirements

### ✅ Core Responsibilities
1. **Schedule Scrum Ceremonies**: Sprint planning, grooming, daily standups, retrospectives, and triaging.
2. **Voice & Chat Analysis**: Transcribe MS Teams meeting voice; use NLP to extract action items.
3. **Task Creation**: Create and assign tasks in MS Teams (Planner), Jira, or other PM tools based on conversations.
4. **Progress Tracking**: Monitor task status and due dates in real-time from MS Teams or Jira to measure progress.
5. **Dashboards**: Feed structured data into Grafana to visualize sprint health and team metrics.
6. **Real-time Monitoring & Escalation**: Trigger reminders or email escalations when tasks stall or miss deadlines.
7. **Chat Assistant**: Answer team queries, provide contact points, task statuses, and suggest mitigations.
8. **Predictive Feedback**: Offer data-driven feedback and highlight potential blockers to the Project Manager.
9. **Host for Scrum Calls**: Agent can optionally act as the call host or use a bot runner via Teams to record and monitor.
10. **Configurable Team Setup**: Set goals, members, roles, levels, sprint cadence, and escalation matrix.
11. **Security & Compliance**: Role-based access control, audit logs, GDPR and ISO compliance.

# 3. Architecture Overview

## 3.1 Multi-Agent Microservice Architecture

- **Scheduler Agent**: Manages scrum calendars
    
- **Voice Analyst Agent**: Transcribes and processes voice
    
- **Task Manager Agent**: Manages task creation, updates
    
- **Dashboard Agent**: Feeds data into Grafana
    
- **Sentinel Agent**: Real-time monitoring and escalation
    
- **Chat Agent**: Q&A for team queries, powered by LLM
    

## 3.2 Integration Points

- Microsoft Teams & Graph API
    
- Azure Speech Services / Whisper AI
    
- Microsoft Planner / Jira
    
- Prometheus/InfluxDB for metrics
    
- Grafana for visualization
    
- Email/Slack for escalations

# 4. Data Flow

1. **Team Meeting** in MS Teams
    
2. **Voice Recording** via Bot Framework
    
3. **Transcription** via Azure Speech
    
4. **Action Item Extraction** using NLP (spaCy/Hugging Face)
    
5. **Task Creation** in Teams Planner or Jira
    
6. **Progress Monitoring** via API Polling/Webhooks
    
7. **Data Storage** in centralized DB or Data Lake
    
8. **Dashboard Update** in Grafana
    
9. **Escalation** via MS Teams bot and Email
